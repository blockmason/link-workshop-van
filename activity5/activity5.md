# Create your web DApp using Truffle (i.e. the 'hard' way)
## Goal
In this activity, we will use the popular Truffle development framework to re-create our Collectible Stamps App from the previous exercise. We will then compare and contrast the two approaches.

The goal after this activity is to have an appreciation of all the steps in the blockchain app development process that are done 'behind the scenes' by Link. 

## Exercise
This activity will require you to:
* Use Truffle - a popular environment and framework for blockchain development
* Use Truffle's `HDWalletProvider` and Infura (https://infura.io) to deploy your smart contract to the public `Ropsten` test network
* Use web3.js for our app to interact with both a local and public blockchain
* Use HTML and JavaScript for the front-end web app, similar to the previous activity

### Setup

> In the `activity5/collectible-stamps-app/` folder, run:
```
    npm install
```
This will install all the node dependencies - have a look in `package.json` to see what those dependencies are. 

> Ensure you have Ganache running a local blockchain at `http://127.0.0.1:7545`.

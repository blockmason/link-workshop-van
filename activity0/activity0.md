# Setup for the Workshop
## Goal
In this activity, we will download all the necessary tools, libraries and applications required for the workshop. 


## Setup

### Terminal and IDE
>It is recommended that you download Visual Studio Code for this workshop https://code.visualstudio.com/. VS Code is a great editor with lots of useful extensions and an integrated Terminal. If there's an existing IDE you prefer to use, that is fine as well. 

### Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)
>Install the latest version of Node.js and npm - https://nodejs.org/en/download/. If you are on OSX, installing using Homebrew is likely the easiest option.

### Blockmason Link
> We will be using the Link blockchain development platform for this workshop. Setup an account by going to https://mason.link/sign-up . You can call your `org` anything you'd like. 

### Ganache
>Ganache is part of the Truffle framework and is essentially a `one-click blockchain` that you can run locally. Download from https://truffleframework.com/ganache. 

### Web Browser
>It is highly recommended that you use Chrome for this workshop in order to use the MetaMask extension. Other browsers that incorporate the MetaMask extension are Opera and Brave.

### MetaMask
>MetaMask is a Chrome extension which interfaces with the Ethereum network from your browser. We will use it to interface with the Ethereum test network, `Ropsten`.

### Infura API Key
Infura provides easy-to-use APIs to interact with the Ethereum network without running your own Ethereum node. Register for an API key at https://infura.io/register. You will then be able to access URLs containing your API key for the Ethereum mainnet and testnets. 

### web3.js
>We will be using the web3.js library extensively in this workshop - https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/getting-started.html. It is worth pointing out that while we will install and use functions locally that are part of the latest documentation, v1.0 is still in beta and has not been released yet! The existing web3 release is 0.2x.x, used by MetaMask for example, and the documentation is provided here: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API.
